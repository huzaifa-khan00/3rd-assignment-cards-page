            <h1>Frontend</h1>
            <p>
              The frontend is the visible part of a website or application —
              everything that users see, interact with, and experience directly.
              It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which together handle
              the structure, styling, and interactivity of the interface. The
              frontend is responsible for visual design, layout, animations,
              responsiveness, and overall user experience, ensuring that the
              application is not only functional but also visually appealing and
              intuitive. Think of it as the face of your application, shaping
              how users perceive and engage with your product.

            <h1>Backend</h1>
            <p>
              The backend is the behind-the-scenes part of a website or
              application that powers all the functionality users interact with
              on the frontend. It handles data processing, storage,
              authentication, server communication, and business logic, ensuring
              that every action a user takes on the frontend results in the
              correct operation. The backend manages databases, APIs, and
              server-side operations, making sure the application runs smoothly
              and securely. You can think of it as the brain of your
              application, orchestrating everything that happens behind the
              scenes.

            <h1>Database</h1>
            <p>
              A database is a system that stores, organizes, and manages
              application data in a structured and efficient way. It allows data
              to be saved, retrieved, updated, and deleted as needed, enabling
              applications to handle information reliably. Databases can handle
              everything from simple user records to complex relationships and
              large-scale datasets. Popular databases include MySQL, MongoDB,
              PostgreSQL, and SQLite, each with its own strengths and use cases
              depending on the application’s requirements. Think of a database
              as the memory and storage system that keeps your application’s
              data safe, organized, and accessible.
